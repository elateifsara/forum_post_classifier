# Build and Deploy a forum post classifier using Flask API/Streamlit with Docker

## Description  

Build an amazon e-commerce forum (from DiscourseHub Community) post classifier that takes the title of a post and its content and classify it into one of the 11 catgories from the amazon e-commerce forum.

## Instructions

1. Train the model using the Colab notebook.
2. Choose the type of deployment you want:
    * Flask API
    * Streamlit  
3. Follow the instructions in the README of each respective solution.  

## Remarks  

Streamlit is super slow. 
There are some suggestions in the DS community to use FastAPI instead of Flask API as its runing engine is faster.
